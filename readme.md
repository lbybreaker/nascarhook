## nascarhook | an internal csgo meme cheat

code is pretty bad. very unfinished, too.

most dependencies are unused (luajit, freetype (didn't fully set up imgui integration), and json), built on whole solution build. 

must have directx 9 (june 2010) sdk installed.

features an unchanging aimbot checkbox!

have fun!
